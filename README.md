roadmap for the libreForms API

## Introduction

The libreForms API is an open API optimized for managing institutional form data over a network. This API supports a variety of implementation architectures, including full-stack and distributed application layouts. The project seeks to simplify how institutions and systems define and manage their forms.

The following projects are planned or in-progress.

- [spec](https://github.com/libreForms/spec): the specification for the libreForms API
- [libreForms-flask](https://github.com/libreForms/libreForms-flask): a full-stack implementation of the libreForms API
